# Type-1-Diabetes-BG-Prediction-XGBoost

Predicting blood glucose levels in Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is of utmost importance due to its direct impact on patient safety, long-term health, and overall quality of life. Maintaining blood sugar within a safe range is critical for preventing life-threatening complications and improving daily diabetes management. One of the most immediate concerns in T1D is preventing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Predicting glucose levels enables timely interventions, such as consuming carbohydrates to prevent a sugar crash or adjusting insulin doses to avoid dangerous spikes.

Accurate blood glucose prediction in Type 1 diabetes is essential for preventing long-term complications such as nerve damage, kidney failure, heart disease, and blindness by maintaining better glycemic control.

Since glucose levels are influenced by multiple factors like diet, stress, and exercise, predictive models help reduce the mental and physical burden on patients and caregivers by providing automated assistance.

## ‚ô®Ô∏èXGBOOST

XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm, which builds an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner to predict a target variable (in this case, glucose levels). It is widely used for regression and classification tasks. It works by combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong model.Each tree in the model corrects the errors made by the previous tree, which helps the model learn from its mistakes and improve its performance. In the context of blood glucose prediction, the objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the glucose levels based on input features. It works particularly well when the relationships between the input features are non-linear or complex.

The model is configured with hyperparameters like the number of trees(n_estimators=100), learning rate(learning_rate=0.1), and the maximum depth
(max_depth=6) of each tree to control the complexity and performance of the model.
